# Windows App Essentials

* Authors: Joseph Lee, Derek Riemer and others

This add-on is a collection of app modules for various modern Windows apps, as well as enhancements and fixes for certain controls found in Windows 10 and later.

Notes:

* This add-on requires Windows 11 23H2 (build 22631) or later with limited support for Windows 10 22H2 (build 19045).
* Feature update support duration is tied to consumer support duration (Home, Pro, Pro Education, Pro for Workstations editions) and the add-on may end support for a feature update prior to end of consumer support. See <https://aka.ms/WindowsTargetVersioninfo> for more information and support dates.
* Although installation is possible, this add-on does not support 32-bit Windows 10, Windows Enterprise LTSC (Long-Term Servicing Channel), and Windows Server releases.
* Not all features from Windows Insider Preview builds will be supported, more so for features introduced to a subset of Windows Insiders.
