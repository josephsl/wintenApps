# Windows App Essentials

* Authors: Joseph Lee, Derek Riemer and others

Note: Originally called Windows 10 App Essentials, it was renamed to Windows App Essentials in 2021 to support Windows 10 and future releases such as Windows 11. Parts of this add-on will still refer to the original add-on name.

This add-on is a collection of app modules for various modern Windows apps, as well as enhancements and fixes for certain controls found in Windows 10 and later.

The following app modules or support modules for some apps are included (see each app section for details on what is included):

* Voice access (Windows 11)

Notes:

* This add-on requires 64-bit Windows 10 22H2 (build 19045), 11 23H2 (build 22631), or later releases.
* Feature update support duration is tied to consumer support duration (Home, Pro, Pro Education, Pro for Workstations editions) and the add-on may end support for a feature update prior to end of consumer support. See <https://aka.ms/WindowsTargetVersioninfo> for more information and support dates.
* Although installation is possible, this add-on does not support Windows Enterprise LTSC (Long-Term Servicing Channel) and Windows Server releases.
* Not all features from Windows Insider Preview builds will be supported, more so for features introduced to a subset of Windows Insiders.

For a list of changes made between each add-on releases, refer to [changelogs for add-on releases][1] document.

## Voice access (Windows 11)

* NVDA will announce Voice access messages such as microphone toggle from everywhere.
