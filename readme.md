# Windows App Essentials

* Authors: Joseph Lee, Derek Riemer and others

IMPORTANT: Windows App Essentials will be discontinued in October 2025.

This add-on is a collection of app modules for various modern Windows apps, as well as enhancements and fixes for certain controls found in Windows 11.

Notes:

* This add-on requires Windows 11 24H2 (build 26100) or later.
* Feature update support duration is tied to consumer support duration (Home, Pro, Pro Education, Pro for Workstations editions) and the add-on may end support for a feature update prior to end of consumer support. See <https://aka.ms/WindowsTargetVersioninfo> for more information and support dates.
* Although installation is possible, this add-on does not support Windows Enterprise LTSC (Long-Term Servicing Channel) and Windows Server releases.
* Not all features from Windows Insider Preview builds will be supported, more so for features introduced to a subset of Windows Insiders.

For a list of changes made between each add-on releases, refer to [changelogs for add-on releases][1] document.
