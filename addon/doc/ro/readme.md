# Windows App Essentials #

* Authors: Joseph Lee, Derek Riemer and others

This add-on is a collection of app modules for various modern Windows apps,
as well as enhancements and fixes for certain controls found in Windows 11.

Note:

* Acest supliment necesită Windows 11 versiunea 24H2 (compilarea 26100) sau
  mai nou.
* Feature update support duration is tied to consumer support duration
  (Home, Pro, Pro Education, Pro for Workstations editions) and the add-on
  may end support for a feature update prior to end of consumer support. See
  <https://aka.ms/WindowsTargetVersioninfo> for more information and support
  dates.
* Although installation is possible, this add-on does not support Windows
  Enterprise LTSC (Long-Term Servicing Channel) and Windows Server releases.
* Not all features from Windows Insider Preview builds will be supported,
  more so for features introduced to a subset of Windows Insiders.
